When a guess command is sent, we send the prompt.
There are 4 possible users to choose from, these users are sampled from all server json data, not just current users
Choices selected with reactions
Multiple prompts can be sent.
We store all prompts in a list.
Each element is the list is a dictionary containing the prompt's message ID and the correct answer and when the prompt was sent.
We periodically check through all our prompts to see if there are answers.
If a prompt was sent over a certain length of time, we edit the prompt to say "Expired"
If a user answers correctly, we edit the answer to remove the censoring and celebrate the win.

Consider having different difficulties.
Harder questions are from longer ago.
Harder questions might also be shorter.


Real or Fake?
User must determine if a message is real or AI generated

Already used.
We might want to move already guessed messages elsewhere
Prompts that expire aren't thrown away.

Do we want to modify the source JSON?
Keep copy of original?
Do we want to store fake messages in the json file?

Stats command
Shows the number of messages already successfully guessed and which ones are still unanswered

Pre-filter json data?

Is there a way to load messages on the fly from Discord
Or do we need to rely on pre-exported data?
